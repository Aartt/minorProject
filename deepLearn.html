                Deep learning is a branch of machine learning which is based on artificial neural networks. It is capable of learning complex patterns and relationships within data. In deep learning, we don’t need to explicitly program everything. It has become increasingly popular in recent years due to the advances in processing power and the availability of large datasets. Because it is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) also known as deep neural networks (DNNs). These neural networks are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain’s biological neurons, and they are designed to learn from large amounts of data.

            <p>
                Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning that involves the use of neural networks to model and solve complex problems. Neural networks are modeled after the structure and function of the human brain and consist of layers of interconnected nodes that process and transform data.
                The key characteristic of Deep Learning is the use of deep neural networks, which have multiple layers of interconnected nodes. These networks can learn complex representations of data by discovering hierarchical patterns and features in the data. Deep Learning algorithms can automatically learn and improve from data without the need for manual feature engineering.
                Deep Learning has achieved significant success in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, speech recognition, and recommendation systems. Some of the popular Deep Learning architectures include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs).
                Training deep neural networks typically requires a large amount of data and computational resources. However, the availability of cloud computing and the development of specialized hardware, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), has made it easier to train deep neural networks.

                An artificial neural network or ANN uses layers of interconnected nodes called neurons that work together to process and learn from the input data.
                <br>
                In a fully connected Deep neural network, there is an input layer and one or more hidden layers connected one after the other. Each neuron receives input from the previous layer neurons or the input layer. The output of one neuron becomes the input to other neurons in the next layer of the network, and this process continues until the final layer produces the output of the network. The layers of the neural network transform the input data through a series of nonlinear transformations, allowing the network to learn complex representations of the input data.
                <br><br>
                Deep learning can be used for supervised, unsupervised as well as reinforcement machine learning. it uses a variety of ways to process these.

                    <li>
                        Machine Learning : Supervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to make predictions or classify data based on the labeled datasets. Here we input both input features along with the target variables. the neural network learns to make predictions based on the cost or error that comes from the difference between the predicted and the actual target, this process is known as backpropagation.  Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional neural networks, Recurrent neural networks are used for many supervised tasks like image classifications and recognization, sentiment analysis, language translations, etc.

                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Unsupervised Machine Learning : Unsupervised machine learning is the machine learning technique in which the neural network learns to discover the patterns or to cluster the dataset based on unlabeled datasets. Here there are no target variables. while the machine has to self-determined the hidden patterns or relationships within the datasets. Deep learning algorithms like autoencoders and generative models are used for unsupervised tasks like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Reinforcement  Machine Learning : Reinforcement  Machine Learning is the machine learning technique in which an agent learns to make decisions in an environment to maximize a reward signal. The agent interacts with the environment by taking action and observing the resulting rewards. Deep learning can be used to learn policies, or a set of actions, that maximizes the cumulative reward over time. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms like Deep Q networks and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) are used to reinforce tasks like robotics and game playing etc.

            <p>Neural Networks are computational models that mimic the complex functions of the human brain. The neural networks consist of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and learn from data, enabling tasks such as pattern recognition and decision making in machine learning, Or we can say that neural network is a method in artificial intelligence that teaches computers to process data in a way that is inspired by the human brain.
                <br><br> It is a type of machine learning process, called deep learning, that uses interconnected nodes or neurons in a layered structure that resembles the human brain. It creates an adaptive system that computers use to learn from their mistakes and improve continuously. Thus, artificial neural networks attempt to solve complicated problems, like summarizing documents or recognizing faces, with greater accuracy.
                <br><br>
                Neural networks can help computers make intelligent decisions with limited human assistance. This is because they can learn and model the relationships between input and output data that are nonlinear and complex.
